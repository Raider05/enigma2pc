  * Update german translation.
  * Add bass downmix support to AC3 decoder.
  * Add experimental YCgCo colorspace support.
  * Add avformat demux plugin.
    - Support for new formats and protocols.
    - Proper rtsp support (with avformat+rtsp://, rtsp+tcp:// and rtsp+http:// mrls).
    - by default native xine demux plugins are probed first.
      This can be overridden in config, by selecting demuxer in mrl (#demux:avformat),
      or by using "avformat+" mrl prefix.
  * Add avio (libavformat) input plugin:
    - Support for new protocols (https://, ftp://, sftp://, ...).
    - Support for seekable http streams (with "avio+http://" mrl).
    - By default native xine input plugins are used. This can be overridden in config or by using "avio+" mrl prefix.
  * Recognise & use HEVC/H.265. (ffmpeg)
  * Add support for HEVC/H.265 to the mpeg-ts demuxer.
  * Add support for HEVC/H.265 and VP9 to the matroska demuxer.

xine-lib (1.2.4) 2013-09-24
  * Some VAAPI plugin fixes (build, image size changes).
  * ffmpeg multi-channel playback fixes:
    - Handle channel configuration changes sooner.
    - Generic layout if none provided; follow user changes.
    - Defer opening output if nothing to play.
    - Don't re-open with identical settings.
    - Don't use the bits-per-sample value (may not match decoder output).
  * ffmpeg video fixes:
    - Default to square pixels, avoiding black bars & unnecessary scaling.
    - Avoid CODEC_FLAG_EMU_EDGE (and some possible segfaults).
    - Use MPEG2VIDEO.
  * OpenGL2 output: don't render into invalid drawable.
  * Fix a possible xine_play() hang related to display locking.
  * FLV demuxer rewrite:

xine-lib (1.2.0) 2012-01-01
  * Add support for VDR.
  * Add support for VDPAU.
  * xine-config is deprecated in favour of pkg-config libxine.
    Use "pkgconfig --variable=foo libxine" where you previously used
    "xine-config --foo".
  * Reorder and modify public structures to reduce the holes caused by padding
    especially on 64-bit architectures.
  * Remove the buttons array from video_overlay, as the feature linked to that
    was never implemented. This change reduces by 10MB the memory usage of
    xine-lib during playback (1/3 of the memory used while playing an mp3).
  * Update libmpcdec (formerly libmusepack) to version 1.2.6 (newer than the
    previous Subversion snapshot) and contextually move it to
    contrib/libmpcdec to separate from xine's own code.
  * Save plugins' cache in the defined cache home directory as per XDG Base
    Directory Specification.
  * Use XDG-defined cache home directory for cddb cache.
  * Use XDG-defined cache home directory for win32codecs fake registry.
  * Use XDG-defined data directories to look up fonts files both while using
    FreeType2 and the standard bitmap fonts for OSD.
  * Replace internal libdts 0.0.2 with libdca 0.0.5, and contextually move it
    to contrib/libdca to separate from xine's own code.
  * Add another message code to allow for auth prompts. Previously, it was
    not possible to distinguish between '401 Authentication Required' and
    '403 Forbidden'.
  * Merge the demuxer and the decoder for NSF files in a combined plugin.
  * Move modplug demuxing to its own plugin. This way, binary distributions
    can make it optional as it requires quite a bit of CPU time during
    initialisation, even for audio files that nothing have to do with modplug.
  * Collapse the Ogg demuxer, and the Theora, Vorbis and Speex decoders in the
    same 'xiph' plugin.
  * Remove aRTs output plugin; ALSA's DMix can allow both xine and aRTs to
    access the audio device at the same time for Linux, and if other
    operating systems lack a proper software mixing facility you can
    consider alternative daemons. Note: aRTs will not be present in KDE 4.
  * Convert the FAQ and the Hacker's Guide from DocBook SGML to DocBook 4.4
    XML, and the figures from fig files to SVG files.
  * The XML parser no longer ignores <?...?> elements.
    Such elements are handled as if they were after the XML content for
    compatibility reasons, though they must appear before it.
  * The XML parser handles CDATA elements.
  * Text handling within XML is improved.
  * DVB subtitles' opacity is now controllable.
  * Extend DVB subtitling capabilities. (Still bitmap-only.)
  * The internal copies of libcdio and libvcd are no longer present,
    you need to use an installed copy of them if you want VCD support.
  * Replace get_* functions for literals with direct string access.
  * Use default dispose() functions when they just need to call free() in
    various plugins.
  * Rename METHOD_BY_EXTENSION to METHOD_BY_MRL as it also checks prefixes
    for specific input protocols.
  * Check for supported extensions before opening the plugin and remove
    redundant core from plugins.
  * Use libavutil-provided implementations for CRC, SHA1 and BASE64 algorithms,
    this makes use of libavutil even outside the FFmpeg decoding plugin,
    but avoid duplication of algorithms between different plugins.
  * Use av_mallocz() when xine_xmalloc_aligned() wouldn't be needed.
  * FFmpeg is now required as an external dependency; if you want to build
    xine-lib from source, please download a copy of FFmpeg from their SVN
    server.
  * Remove SyncFB video output plugin, the kernel module needed is no more
    active and thus it's no more usable. If you were using SyncFB somehow,
    please use DirectFB or VIDIX instead.
  * The Xv and XxMC video output plugins now support Xv port selection via
    two methods: port number and port type (currently "any", "overlay" and
    "textured video"). Port number takes precedence; the plugins will fall
    back on another port of the same type (if a type was specified) then on
    whatever they can find.
    XvMC does not support port selection at present.
  * Report more video output capabilities via (port)->get_capabilities():
    colour controls, zooming, colour keying.

      (ref. TKADV2009-004, CVE-2009-0698)
    - Fix an integer overflow in the Quicktime demuxer.
      (TKADV2009-005, CVE-2009-1274)

  * Fix WAV demuxer to send the last frames when they don't fit perfectly into
    the buffer

xine-lib (1.1.15) 2008-08-14
  * Security fixes:
    - Fix crashes with various corrupted media files, including Ogg.
      (CVE-2008-3231)
      This includes a libfaad update from the 1.2 branch.
    - Delay V4L video frame preallocation until we know how large they'll be.
      (CVE-2008-5245)
    - Fix an exploitable ID3 heap buffer overflow.
      (CVE-2008-5234, vector 2)

    - Add some checks for memory allocation failures.
      (CVE-2008-5233)
    - Fix crashes with MP3 files with metadata consisting only of separators.
      (CVE-2008-5248)
  * Use external ffmpeg and libfaad by default.
  * V4L: Don't segfault if asked for an input that doesn't exist.
  * Recognise AMR audio (normally found in 3GP files).
  * Recognise Snow video.
  * Xv deinterlacing didn't take the size of the deinterlaced image into
    account; on some chipsets, this would cause image corruption, while on
    others, there would be no problem.
  * V4L: only try and set the tuner if we're going to use it. Setting the tuner
    when using baseband video (CVBS, S-Video) breaks the input.

xine-lib (1.1.14) 2008-06-29
  * DVB changes:
    - Reacquire PIDs whenever a PMT is parsed. (Some channels' PIDs are
      changed on a regular basis.)
    - Recognise more stream formats (as defined in the broadcast PMT).
    - Allow automatic detection of more DVB tuning parameters.
    - Allow the GUI to be disabled.
    - Allow configuration of the location of channels.conf.
  * V4L: allow TV standard selection.
  * Allow input plugins to report MIME type information.
    This is used for demuxer plugin selection immediately before testing the
    filename extension (so it won't work when demuxer selection is done by
    stream content only). [Bug #120]
  * Allow input plugins to ask for a specific demuxer, overriding the normal
    demuxer selection methods. (Most won't need this.)
  * The Xv and XxMC video output plugins now support Xv port selection via
    two methods: port number and port type (currently "any", "overlay" and
    "textured video"). Port number takes precedence; the plugins will fall
    back on another port of the same type (if a type was specified) then on
    whatever they can find.
    XvMC does not support port selection at present.
    (Backported from the 1.2 branch.)
  * Fix MPEG TS audio stream problems introduced in 1.1.13.
  * Add basic aspect ratio detection for Windows Media Video streams.

xine-lib (1.1.13) 2008-06-15
  * Security fixes:
    - Buffer overflow in the NSF demuxer which may allow remote attackers to
      cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code
      via an NSF file with a long title or copyright message. (CVE-2008-1878)
    - For extra safety against possible Integer overflows like the ones found
      in CVE-2008-1482, backport more calloc usage from 1.2 branch.
  * Improved JACK output plugin.
  * Added MIME types and .mpp for musepack.
  * Fixed display of some MJPEG streams (YUVJ420P).
  * Deprecate xine_xmalloc() function, see src/xine-utils/utils.c for more
    information about the reason.
  * Provide a useful implementation of xine_register_log_cb().

xine-lib (1.1.12) 2008-04-14
  * Security fixes:
    - Insufficient boundary check in speex audio decoder. (CVE-2008-1686)
  * Fixed and improved the PulseAudio driver.
  * Fixed a regression in 1.1.11.1 which broke Quicktime container handling.
  * And another, this time in the Matroska demuxer.
  * Added a tool to assist with generating front ends' desktop files. It
    lists MIME types & filename extensions known to the installed xine-lib.
  * Various Real codec improvements, including:
    - RV20 no longer causes segfaults (observed on amd64);
    - Cook is now handled by ffmpeg.
  * Added a video output plugin intended for passing raw data to the front end.

xine-lib (1.1.11.1) 2008-03-30
  * Security fixes:
    - Integer overflows in FLV, Qt, Real, WC3Movie, Matroska and FILM
      demuxers, allowing remote attackers to trigger heap overflows and
      possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-1482)
  * Added a few more memory allocation checks to the above demuxers.
  * WAV file playback fix: don't assume that the first chunk is "fmt ".
  * Don't try to play partial 24-bit AIFF frames (decoder would lose data).
  * Fixed AIFF comment chunk handling and sample rate reading.
  * LPCM fixes: input over-reading, conversion of 24-bit samples.

xine-lib (1.1.11) 2008-03-19
  * Security fixes:
    - Array Indexing Vulnerability in sdpplin_parse(). (CVE-2008-0073)
  * Reworked the plugin directory naming so that external plugins don't have
    to be rebuilt for every release. We now use a naming scheme based on the
    API/ABI versioning, checking older directories - with this release, the
    plugin directory name is 1.20, and if this gets bumped to 1.21 in a
    future release, 1.20 will still be available for external plugins.
    (Any directories not 1.* won't be looked in.)
  * Made the version parsing much more reliable; it wasn't properly coping
    with four-part version numbers. This affects any program whose build
    scripts use xine-lib's automake macros.
  * Fixed an off-by-one in the FLAC security fix patch. This breakage was
    causing failure to play some files.
  * Support 16-bit big-endian DTS audio.
  * Improved frame snapshot API. (ABI extension.)
  * Re-add support for # (stream parameter separator) in raw filenames,
    without the bugs found in the original implementation.
    (This is a convenience feature for users only. Front ends which rely on
    it for functions like subtitle file detection must instead use file://
    MRLs; if they don't, we consider them to be buggy.)
  * Fixed long delay when closing stream on dual core systems [Bug #33]
  * DVD playback improvement: don't trust the file sizes.
  * Build fixes for use with recent ffmpeg.

xine-lib (1.1.10.1) 2008-02-07
  * Security fixes:
    - Array index vulnerability which may allow remote attackers to execute
      arbitrary code via a crafted FLAC tag, causing a stack buffer overflow.
      (CVE-2008-0486)
    - Buffer overflow in the Matroska demuxer (demuxers/demux_matroska.c)
      which may allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
      or possibly execute arbitrary code via a Matroska file with invalid
      frame sizes. (CVE-2008-1161)
  * Fix a RealPlayer codec detection bug.
  * Improve detection of MP3 streams with ID3v2 tags. Don't trust the tag
    size.

xine-lib (1.1.10) 2008-01-26
  * Security fixes:
    - Buffer overflow which allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary
      code or crash the client program via a crafted ASF header.
      (CVE-2008-1110, related to CVE-2006-1664)
  * Update Ogg and Annodex mimetypes and extensions.
  * Change the default v4l device paths to /dev/video0 and /dev/radio0.
  * Fix support for subtitles with schemes (e.g. http://), partly broken
    since 1.1.8.
  * Unescape the filename in "#save:". This allows filenames to contain ';'
    etc. without ambiguity, e.g. "#save:foo%3B1.ts" -> "foo;1.ts", but front
    end authors should be careful with xine-lib older than 1.1.10.
  * Backported xine-config & libxine.pc from 1.2.
    Consequently, xine-config now requires pkg-config.
  * Don't discard audio samples forever. Fixed streaming playback.
  * Fix a possible crash on channel change in the DVB plugin.
  * Flash video demuxer improvements and bug fixes.
  * Make the V4L ALSA audio input device configurable. (This needs more work.)

    This requires conversion to UTF-8 of entities with codes >= 128.
  * Handle initial Unicde BOMs in XML; convert other UTF encodings to UTF-8.
  * Fixed ATSC support. [Bug SF 1749508]
  * Fixed a possible DVB plugin crash when switching channels.
  * Fixed a crash closing the frontend. [Bug #7]
  * Fixed deadlock on ao_close while paused.

  * Fixed a crash that happened when a video output was closed
  * Made the Real demuxer recognise simple lists of http references.
  * Require correct URL encoding of '#'s which aren't separators.
  * Don't decode %nn in raw filenames. [Bug SF 1784272]
  * Always enable a52dec capabilities for external a52dec, this makes it
    possible to use the DJB accelerated FFT when using the external a52dec
    liba52 library. [Bug #9]
  * Fixed an input_pvr issue with 'set input' for ivtv versions 0.10.6+
  * demux_aiff: only check for chunk's size being lesser than 100 when
    reading the COMM_TAG. [Bug #6]

    encodings other than UTF-8. (There is probably still some breakage here.)

xine-lib (1.1.8) 2007-08-27
  * Send a channel-changed event to the frontend when receiving the SYNC
    string from last.fm streaming server.
  * Disable mediaLib support by default (the licenses probably disallow the
    distribution of xine binaries built against mediaLib, and on non-VIS
    capable boxes it's probably worse than our own code).
  * Rename endianness-reading macros so that they don't collide with Solaris
    system macros. BE_/LE_ are now _X_BE_ and _X_LE_.
  * Add an extra function to allow front ends to rename their old,
    badly-named configuration items.
  * Various build fixes and cleanups for Solaris, plugin dependencies etc.
  * Fix some memory leaks in the Vorbis decoder and video overlays.
  * Fix a problem with the goom plugin which could cause it to stop working.
  * Clean up "%" unescaping in MRLs; correctly handle "%" in DVD and VCD MRLs.

    Mitchell for reporting and testing the fix.
  * Avoid zero-sized frames when demuxing MPEG PES.
  * Improved MPEG2 detection and optimised processing.
  * Extract AFD information (commonly used in UK DVB-T) from the MPEG stream.
  * Ensure that the ffmpeg video image size is properly initialised.
  * Allow XxMC to switch back to software decoding; don't deinterlace if it's
    not needed for any given frame.
  * Document "dvba:" MRLs (ATSC with full tuning info).
  * Fix VCD playback (broken since 1.1.4).
  * Fix demuxing of FLAC files with ID3v2 tags.
  * Use the integer versions of Speex decoding functions, this avoids an
    iteration over the decoded frames to transform them to integers, and
    also avoids an improper saturation.
  * Prioritize the musepack demuxer over mpgaudio, as sometimes the latter can
    misfire and report a good file as unplayable.
  * Fix an mmap problem with huge files on 32-bit systems.
  * Improved MPEG PES stream handling: specifically, misdetection of data
    streams as PES streams.
  * Handle unplugged ALSA device (fixes crashes) and if the frontend does not
    handle the event continue playback to the none output.
  * Disable aRTs output plugin by default, it's deprecated and will be removed
    in 1.2 series.
  * Fix a colour format conversion crash in the fb video output driver.

xine-lib (1.1.6) 2007-04-17
  * Split the DirectFB plugin into X11 and non-X versions.
  * Improve the Mac OS X video output plugin. Thanks to Matt Messier.
  * Fixed the XcbXv plugin - an empty plugin would be built if "old" Xv
    isn't detected.
  * Reworked the channels.conf file handling in the DVB plugin. Previously,
    with junk content, the plugin could potentially consume lots of memory
    (possibly causing a local DoS). Also, a few small memory leaks have been
    eliminated.
  * Fixed a CDDA-related crash and a DVD-related hang, both caused by the
    same change in 1.1.5.

xine-lib (1.1.5) 2007-04-10
  * Security fixes:
    - Fix heap overflow in DMO and DirectShow loaders.
      Thanks to Kees Cook for reporting.
      (CVE-2007-1246 & CVE-2007-1387) [Bug SF 1676925]
  * Improved PulseAudio plugin, now only one connection per instance is opened
    and the mainloop is threaded to reduce latency during playback.
  * Added XCB-based output plugins (Xv and XShm), to use in software using
    XCB to talk with the server rather than libX11 (like new Kaffeine).
    The plugins are contributed by Christoph Pfister with the help of
    Vincent Torri, Jamey Sharp and Christophe Thommeret.
  * Fix race condition in alsa audio out driver.
  * Fixed a crash in the eq2 plugin. [Bug SF 1644312]
  * Fixed content type detection for AAC (seekable) streams with ID3v2
    tags prefixed clobbering the preview buffer, by skipping over the tag.
  * Parse ID3v2 tags on AAC and FLAC files, as well as mp3 files.
  * Priority of the AAC encoder is now lower than anything else, so
    it's not going to crash xine down if you try to run an mp3 stream
    on FAAD2.
  * Relicense the xine-lib XML parser under the GNU LGPL, for use in other
    projects.
  * Improvement in portability to Solaris and NetBSD, thanks to Albert Lee and
    Sergey Svishchev respectively.
  * Spanish translation updated by Carlos E. Robinson M.
  * Don't leave libstk support to be detected automagically; also made it
    disabled by default as upstream is dead and a different libstk is found
    on Debian.
  * Improvement in portability to FreeBSD, merged some patches (with changes)
    from the ports.
  * Cleaned up Real binary codecs support, adding support for FreeBSD (still
    to be completely cleaned up though), and to 64-bit platforms. Also add
    two new configure option, one to enable or disable building of Real binary
    support altogether and one to choose the path where to look for the codecs
    by default (it can, and probably should) be different from the Win32
    codecs path.
  * Avoid a possible floating-point exception when starting stream playback.
  * Now xine can play correctly media on HTTP servers reporting status codes
    but no status message.
  * Wave files with 24-bit integer PCM streams now should play correctly
    (downplayed to 16-bit).
  * Added centre-cutout (4:3 in 16:9) to the expand plugin.
    Patch by Reinhard Nissl.
  * Fix support of block devices for AC3 and DTS demuxers. Thanks to Matthias
    Kretz for the original patch.
  * Portability fixes for Mac OS X, in particular Mac OS X on the new Intel
    Macs. Thanks to Martin Aumueller, Emanuele Giaquinta and Matt Messier.
  * Fix amp muting when level is still at 100. Patch by Reinhard Nissl.
  * Create at least a 1×1 shared image when the first frame is skipped (and
    thus reported as 0×0), to avoid disabling shared memory for all others.
    Patch by Reinhard Nissl.
  * Send an event when the amp level is modified. Patch by Reinhard Nissl.
  * Add support for H.264 video stream in PES packets. Patch by Reinhard Nissl.
  * Support multiple audio PID in MPEG TS. Patch by Julian Scheel.
  * Improvement in portability to OpenBSD, thanks to Pascal S. de Kloe.

xine-lib (1.1.4) 2007-01-28
  * Mark string-type configuration items according to whether they're plain
    strings or names of files, device nodes or directories. This information
    is available to front ends (via .num_value) so that they can present
    file/dir-open dialogue boxes if they so choose.
    Subtitle font selection is split up due to this.
  * Applied the patch to fix text relocation, provided by PaX Team for Gentoo
    and previously applied by other distributions as well. Fixes the non-PIC
    code being generated. Note: patch reverted for tomsmocomp (segfault).
  * Fix race condition in audio_out by using a recursive mutex; patch by
    Reinhard Nissl. [Bug SF 1551911]
  * Allow building with Sun CC by fixing the lprintf variadic macro; patch by
    Taso N. Devetzis. [Bug SF 1614406]

  * Fix invalid memory access in Real Media SDP with tailored stream; reported
    by Roland Kay. [Bug SF 1602631]
  * Don't check for libpostproc version and assume that if libavcodec is found
    correctly, libpostproc is of the same version, too. Reported by Ville
    Skyttä. [Bug SF 1617344]
  * Fix Shorten demuxer: the whole "ajkg" signature has to be found, not only
    one character of it. [Bug SF 1601134]
  * Implement at least a partial content-based detection of ModPlug-decoded
    module files, using the magic numbers from GNU file. This allows to open
    module files based on content rather than on their extension only.
    [Bug SF 1445746]
  * Make the libFLAC-based decoder and demuxer for FLAC files work with recent
    FLAC release 1.1.3.
  * Replace --enable-flac configure option with --with-libflac, as the FLAC
    support is always built-in through the audio demuxer plugin and the FFmpeg
    decoder plugin, the option only controls the extra FLAC plugin that uses
    libFLAC both for demuxing and decoding.
  * Implement a True Audio files demuxer. [Bug SF 1586381]
  * Allow decoding of MusePack SV 7.x files (7.1 files at least play fine).

  * Fix several segfaults and freezing problem with H264 streams that use a lot
    of reference frames (eg. 15) [Bugs SF 1603305, SF 1576588, SF 1267713]
  * Fix mpeg4 artifacts introduced in cvs (not present in 1.1.3)
    [Bug SF 1625911]
  * Initial support to enable/disable ffmpeg codecs. Codecs may be disabled in
    groups by --disable-ffmpeg-uncommon-codecs/--disable-ffmpeg-popular-codecs
    Think of "uncommon" codecs what people would never want to play with their
    PDAs (they will save memory by removing them).
    Note: currently both uncommon/popular codecs are _build_ but disabled.
    that is, build system still need some improvements to really save memory.
  * Fix possible division by zero when pausing (video_out.c).
  * Allow disabling build of musepack decoder through a ./configure parameter
    (--disable-musepack).
  * Allow using external libmpcdec for MusePack decoding rather than the
    internal copy of an old libmusepack, through a ./configure parameter
    (--with-external-libmpcdec).
  * Add support for WavPack files, with both a demuxer and a decoder using
    WavPack library. As an alternative, FFmpeg's audio decoder can be used
    to decode WavPack files.
  * Don't crash when caching a file opened through Samba plugin, thanks to
    Timothy Redaelli from Gentoo.
  * Fix audio/video sync problem with NTSC DVDs (introduced in 1.1.2).

    plugins to export only the plugin info entry (and eventual needed
    special functions), to replace the min-symtab option that wasn't working.
  * Add "m4b" to the list of supported file extensions for the Qt demuxer, to
    allow playing (unprotected) audiobooks in AAC format.
  * Remove --disable-fpic hack, prefer using --without-pic instead.
  * Add new output plugin: PulseAudio (based on PolypAudio plugin), that uses
    0.9 API (PulseAudio is PolypAudio renamed).

    small little changes before we go for the next big architecture update
    that will be in the 0.3.x series

xine (0.2.3) 2000-10-15

  - included patches by Alan Cox:
    net_plugin, bug fixes (i.e. VCD ...)
  - xshm video output module fixed for bpp>16
    (but don't use that for speed reasons!)
  - new iDCT_mmx code from walken
    => picture quality massively improved :))
  - FAQ update
  - speed improvements due to new compiler switches
  - minor Makefile fixes for FreeBSD ports
